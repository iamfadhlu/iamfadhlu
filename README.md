Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> I am a **`Smart Contract Developer`** based in Nigeria.

I love building smart contracts that are functional, secure and gas optimized and I definitely don’t need coffee to make it happen :) 
Outside of work, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and staying current with the tech world.
