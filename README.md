Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> I am a **`Smart Contract Security Researcher`**.

I break code to fish out bugs, keeping the blockchain safe...kinda like  **BATMAN** of the blockchain :) 
Outside of work, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and staying current with the tech world.
